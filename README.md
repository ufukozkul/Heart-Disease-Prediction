# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict heart disease from the medical scanning and blood sample data. It has been stated that the number of patients with heart failure worldwide was 64.3 million in 2017. This alone accounts great expenses on the global society due to specialized methods and equipments that are employed for diagnosis of heart disease. Predicting the condition with machine learning techniques would help reducing the costs as well as making the process simpler for the healthcare workers.
